# Dbot - Discord command bot

A small modular discord micro-bot written in Python.


Originally it was a bot made for a private community so the original code may
be a few years old but I've updated it for Python3.6 (Discord dosen't yet 
support 3.7 as of writing) and stripped down the bot to a skeleton of what it
originally so it's a easy to running and expand with your own extensions.


## TLDR (Python 3.6)
pip install -r requrements.txt
./main.py

Important note:
Make sure you are authorizing your bot to allowing the bot yo join your server
by using this link and replacing <CLIENT_ID> with your client_id number.
